However, the raised stone structures could be considered part of the terrain if they were natural ground, but they are man-made. The definition of terrain excludes paved areas, so this is not terrain. The class 'terrain' is not present.\n- car: No car is visible in the image.\n- truck: No truck is visible in the image.\n- bus: No bus is visible in the image.\n- train: No train is visible in the image.\n- motorcycle: No motorcycle is visible in the image.\n- bicycle: No bicycle is visible in the image.\n- rider: No rider is visible in the image.\n- traffic light: No traffic light is visible in the image."
