However, the definition says \"A human that would use some device to move\" and \"includes, riders/drivers of bicycle, motorbike, scooter, skateboards, horses, roller-blades, wheel-chairs, road cleaning cars, cars without roof.\" Since the person is inside a car, and the car is a vehicle, the person is a rider.
